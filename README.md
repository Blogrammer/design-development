# Design Driven Development

Writing more spaghetti code has produced more a tangled code pattern.

Writing clean code from the start in a project is an investment in keeping 
the cost of change as constant as possible throughout the lifecycle of a 
software product. 

Code is clean if it can be understood easily â€“ by everyone on the team. With 
understandability comes readability, changeability, extensibility and 
maintainability. All the designs needed to keep a project going over a long 
time without accumulating up a large amount of spaghetti code will be covered in this project.


# Table-Driven
Table-driven methods are schemes that allow you to look up information in a table rather than using logic statements (i.e. case, if). 
In simple cases, it's quicker and easier to use logic statements, but as the logic chain becomes more complex, 
table-driven code is simpler than complicated logic, easier to modify and more efficient.   
Table Driven Design is an alternative to switch-case and if-else statements. It is based on key value pairs. 
Therefore, memorized key-value pairs are the main trick.   
Separation of Concerns is an essential milestone.
